nginx and mongoose are essentially web servers

mongoose is often times used with express, as mongoose provides the front-end server connection to let's say a backend mongodb. It is said that mongoose is the ODM object data model for Mongodb. 

Express is merely a nodejs application framework and nodejs is merely a run-time environment for javascript, providing I/O services. Mongoose is often times used with expressjs to connect to mongodb.

mlab is free mongodb hosting.
